  <h3>Network Project — Cisco Packet Tracer</h3>
  <p>This project demonstrates a VLAN setup with Staff (VLAN 10) and Student (VLAN 20) networks, including routers, switches, servers, and PCs. I configured inter-VLAN routing, assigned IP addresses manually, tested connectivity between devices, and ensured proper network segmentation.</p>
  <p><strong>Skills gained:</strong> VLAN configuration, inter-VLAN routing, IP addressing, subnetting, network troubleshooting, and Packet Tracer simulation.</p>
